Instructions and settings for use with Auto-GPT autonomous agents

## Background

In the last month, the [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/blob/master/README.md) project has gained rapid interest in demonstrating the potential of harnessing large language models in an autonomous manner. Since Auto-GPT project is an early experiment, it doesn't yet have robust features for organizing instructions or persisting the results of an agent run.

The repo is a simple way to store, share, and iterate on instructions and settings. It may also serve as a historical record of agent executions by creating new branches and/or tags for a given run and committing relevant output produced or logs.
